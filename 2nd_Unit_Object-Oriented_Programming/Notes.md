1-INTRODUCTION 
EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT, JAVA KIT DEVELOPMENT, JAVA VIRTUAL MACHINE 

The orograms can run on Windows as well as Linux or Android. 
For this, there is a development platform: JDK (compiler, scrubber and documents generator). 
Execution: JRE (JVM)-> Java Runrime Environment + Java Virtual Machine. 
Code and execution of app.java. 
Once the program has been compiled, we obtain a .class file that can be executed on different operating systems. 

MAIN STRUCTURE OF A JAVA PROJECT 
Main: all instructions mus be delimitated with open and close brackets (which replace the begin..end statements in Pascal). 
All the sentences are separated for ; in the end of line. 
Indentation is recommended (it works equally, but its use enhance the code reading.)
Comments: 
-/* */  for multiple lines 
-//    for unique line 

Case-Sensitive: Java is sensible to upper and lower case.
